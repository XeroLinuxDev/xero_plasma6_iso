<h1 align="center">How to build XeroLinux</h1>

### Step 1 - Clone Build Repo :

Grab the build environment. Just note that you will need Git installed in order to do that.

**Grab Build Env.**
```
cd ~ && git clone https://github.com/xerolinux/xero_plasma6_iso.git
```

### Step 2 - Building the Xero ISO :

Now that we have build environment on our system, it's time to build it.

**Build the ISO :**
```
cd ~/xero_plasma6_iso/ && ./build.sh
```

The build process might chug a bit, hinging on your rig's specs. Once it wraps, brace for the root password prompt to tidy up the buildscape. Voila! Your ISO emerges victorious in `~/Xero-Out/`. Time to dive in and unleash the fun!

I hope this helps.. In case of other issues kindly find me on [**Discord**](https://discord.gg/Xg6T78ahtK)

Happy building

*May You Live Long & Prosper*...
